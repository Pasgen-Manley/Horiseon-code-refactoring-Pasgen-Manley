# Horiseon-code-refactoring-Pasgen-Manley

## About this project

The purpose of this project was to refactor the code, of an existing website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. The code was already working fine and was functional, however, it needed some tuning in terms of accessibility. This was so when other developers work on the website's code down the track they will have a much easier and faster time working with the current code.

### What was changed

* Alt attribute descriptions were added to the images in the html.
* The title of the page was changed from website to Horiseon.
* div elements which were used to section of content were changed to main and aside elements. This was to better detail where particular content should fall and better the semantic flow.
* Many elements in the CSS were condensed, as there were many unnecessary doubles and triples of the same code.
* Comments were added in the CSS to section group up similar elements for better flow and accessibility.
